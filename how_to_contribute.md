## How To Contribute To The Curriculum

We are looking for educators, scientists, makers, and education enthusiasts to support this project by writing unique content for our curriculum!  If the idea of a free curriculum, grounded in active learning (and some humane values like sustainability and community), appeals to you, please join us.

Currently we have several curricular modules being writting by different parties that will be put together into our first text release for school use by early spring 2015.  Right now, we are primarily writing content that is appropriate for middle school and high school science teachers of varying subjects.  All content will be written with the intention it can be taught in a hands-on matter.  Please remember, all content being contributed will be distributed free to the public. 

If you would like have your content in our first release, please [send us an e-mail](/#contact) with the following information:
1. Who are you? (i.e., background? interest in education? experience in education?)
2. What topic would your module be on?
3. When would you be able to submit it by?

We are open to just about anything that has a solid educational value, is based in a correct understanding of the subject matter, is active and fun for kids, and understandable to teachers.
