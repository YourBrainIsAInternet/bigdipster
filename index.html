            <p>
            We are creating a free, modular curriculum for supporting middle school and high school teachers in building active learning environments for their students.  Our content is contributed by subject-matter experts and curated by our team of educators, scientists, and artists.  Right now we are in the process of putting together our first online textbook, which will comprise of a range of science modules.  If you want more information, browse to our <a href="about.html">about page</a>.  If you would like to contribute to our first release, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.

            <h2>How To Contribute</h2>

            <p>We are looking for educators, scientists, makers, and education enthusiasts to support this project by writing unique content for our curriculum!  If the idea of a free curriculum, grounded in active learning (and some humane values like sustainability and community), appeals to you, please join us.</p>

            <p>Currently we have several curricular modules being writting by different parties that will be put together into our first text release for school use by early spring 2015.  Right now, we are primarily writing content that is appropriate for middle school and high school science teachers of varying subjects.  All content will be written with the intention it can be taught in a hands-on matter.  Please remember, all content being contributed will be distributed free to the public. </p>
