## 1) Is it free?
Yes! EduWeb is a completely free, open source platform, in order to involve as many teachers and
classrooms as possible. We believe STEM education shouldn't be confined to those with more financial
opportunity.

## 2) What makes this different from traditional textbooks?
EduWeb is unique in its modular structure.  What we mean by this, is that individual lessons, called
**modules** can be added or taken away from the teacher's **curricular web**, so as to better
customize the course to the teacher's needs.  Due to the web structure, even if modules are left
out, the curriculum will still be robust in its conceptual connectivity, thus allowing teachers to
fine tune their course without leaving out important linchpins to the students' understanding.

## 3) How will I assess my students?
Along with each module, a list of recommended discussion points and questions will be provided,
however it is up to the teacher to holistically evaluate the students' performance on the module
based off of his or her participation and creativity in the included hands on activity.  By
evaluating the students' engagement in the lesson, and performance in the activity, the transfer
of *actual* knowledge as opposed to ritualistic regurgitation of a predefined list of words will be
more apparent.

## 4) What does my classroom need to do these activities?
Every module will be accompanied with a list of relevant materials. Some materials are essential but
others can be creatively replaced by the student or teacher, to further promote a feeling of
creation and discovery in the process of performing the lesson. We believe that the feeling of
agency is paramount in a students' interest in science. A space to explore and make one's own
decisions will encourage even the more hesitant students.

## 5) Will these exercises conform to the standards of Common Core?
No idea.  Probably?  Look science is science, fuck the common core.  lorem ipsum lorem ispsum to be
continued.

## 6) Can curricular material be downloaded/uploaded from/to this website?
Not sure what features the website will have yet but yeah, eventually it'd be nice if teachers could
uplaod specific handouts they designed for each module and it might be nice if we made some too.

## 7) What are the affiliations of this website?
At the moment this website has no external affiliation.  The modules are written by a handful of
eager young expositors of science, and the design of the website itself is done pro bono by coders
with similar interests in science and pedagogy.
